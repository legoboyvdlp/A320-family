## Navdata
It is highly reccomended to purchase a NAVIGRAPH subscription and download their level d FMSDATA / waypoint / navaid data! If you do not wish to do that, there is older data linked below. But it won't have most of the newer procedures, and is only for a limited number of airports, as naturally it is not possible to distribute commercial data. If runway numbering changed, it is quite possible that it will not work due to FlightGear limitations in the routing code.

To install navdata, create a folder FMSDATA, and add it to your additional scenery folders, at the top of the list. Inside that folder, place all the XXXX.procedures.xml files, in the format FMSDATA/X/X/X/XXXX.procedures.xml. For instance, FMSDATA/Airports/E/G/K/EGKK.procedures.xml. 

## Installation
If you have issues installing, please check INSTALL.MD!
Specifically, make sure you remove -dev from the folder name!
