To add an additional condition to bring voltage to comm radios.

### Description of Changes
*I do not have airbus specs for the navcom radio control panels, but I believe the following:*
There are three navcom radio control panels and each has an on/off switch which stands between the voltage source and the navcom radio stack.
The three control panels are wired in parallel, at least one of the three switches must be 'on' for the dc-ess voltage to reach
the navcom radio stack.
If anyone has an authoritative, study level resource on how the radio control panels and audio panels work I would very much appreciate receiving
a web url to it or a copy of it, thank you! - SW
